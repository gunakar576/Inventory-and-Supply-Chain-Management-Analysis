## Days Sales of Inventory (DSI)
- **Value:** 15.56 days â†’ On average, inventory is sold within ~16 days.  
- **Insight:** Indicates fast-moving inventory and lower holding costs.

## Inventory Turnover
- **Value:** 23.47 â†’ Inventory is turned over 23 times per year, reflecting strong movement.  
- **Insight:** Suggests good demand and efficient inventory management, but combined with low warehouse utilization, it highlights excess capacity.
